Data Carpentry's aim is to teach researchers basic concepts, skills, and tools for working with data so that they can get more done in less time, and with less pain.

> ## Getting Started
>
> Data Carpentryâ€™s teaching is hands-on, so participants are encouraged to use
> their own computers to ensure the proper setup of tools for an efficient
> workflow. To most effectively use these materials, please make sure to download
> the data and install everything before working through this lesson.
>
> This workshop assumes no prior experience with the tools covered in the workshop. However, **learners with prior experience working with geospatial data may be able to skip episodes 1-4, which focus on geospatial concepts and tools.**
> Similarly, learners who have prior experience with the `Python` programming language may wish to skip the
> [Plotting and Programming in Python](https://swcarpentry.github.io/python-novice-gapminder/index.html) lesson.
>
> To get started, follow the directions in the [Setup](setup.html) tab to
> get access to the required software and data for this workshop.

> ## Data
>
> The data used in this lesson includes optical satellite images from [the Copernicus Sentinel-2 mission](https://sentinel.esa.int/web/sentinel/missions/sentinel-2)
> and public geographical datasets from [the dedicated distribution platform of the Dutch government](https://www.pdok.nl).
>
> These are real-world data sets that entail sufficient complexity to teach many aspects of data analysis and management.
> They have been selected to allow students to focus on the core ideas and skills being taught while offering the chance
> to encounter common challenges with geospatial data.
>
> Follow the directions in the [Setup](setup.html) tab to download the required files.

# Workshop Overview

| Lesson Starting Points                                                                                 | Overview |
|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------| ---------- |
| [Episode 1: Introduction to Raster Data]({{ site.baseurl }}/01-intro-raster-data/)                     | Understand data structures and common storage and transfer formats for spatial data. Start here if you want to understand fundamental geospatial concepts like coordinate reference systems, rasters, and vectors.|
| [Plotting and Programming in Python](https://swcarpentry.github.io/python-novice-gapminder/index.html) | Import data into Python, calculate summary statistics, and create publication-quality graphics. Start here if you have an understanding of geospatial concepts but want to learn Python fundamentals. |
| [Episode 5: Access satellite imagery using Python]({{ site.baseurl }}/05-access-data/)                 | Open, work with, and plot vector and raster-format spatial data in Python. Start here if you already have a good grasp of geospatial concepts and a working knowledge of Python.|
